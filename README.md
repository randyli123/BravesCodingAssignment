Used d3 library to create vis.

### Reasoning
I chose to use the Launch Angle, Exit Speed, and Outcome when visualizing the data given. I wanted to find which velocities and which launch angles were best when hitting a baseball. With the scatterplot, we can see the tendencies of certain velocities and launch angles and see if there are any similiarities. This is possible because of the colorcoded points based on the outcome, so we can tell which pair of exit speeds and launch angles resulted in which outcome. The results of the visualization were consisitent to the optimal launch angle I found on Google. I chose to exclude the errors and undefined from the points. I also put the fielder's choice and sacrifice as orange, since it looks similiar to the color of outs, since sacrifices and fielder's choices are most similiar to an out in my opinion.
